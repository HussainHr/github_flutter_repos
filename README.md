### üöÄ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/HussainHr/github_flutter_repos.git
   cd github-flutter-repos
2. Install Dependencies
   bash
   flutter pub get
3. Create Environment Files
   Create .env.dev file in the root directory:
   envBASE_URL=https://api.github.com
   API_TIMEOUT=30000
   DEBUG_MODE=true
   Create .env.prod file in the root directory:
   envBASE_URL=https://api.github.com
   API_TIMEOUT=30000
   DEBUG_MODE=false
4. Generate JSON Serialization Code
   bash
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
      This generates the repository_model.g.dart file needed for JSON parsing.
5. Run the Application
   For Development:
   bash
   flutter run --dart-define=ENV=dev
      For Production:
      bash
   flutter run --dart-define=ENV=prod
                 # Reusable widgets
